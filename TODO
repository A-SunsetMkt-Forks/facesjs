# male/female

- add option similar to race, default to male
- add race/gender to editor as randomize buttons
- somehow label all svgs as male/female/both
  - do we need to have concept of probabilistic both, like usually this is not for males but sometimes it is?
  - could do it in filenames, or in some JSON document with a script to check that all are there
